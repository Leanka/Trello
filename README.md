#### About project

It's a simple planning application based on [Trello](https://trello.com/). 
>After signing up and logging in, it allows user to create projects and in them - lists filled up with tasks. Tasks are dragable, editable, can be reordered, removed or marked as done by doubleclick.

Project consists of two parts, developped as separate applications:
- frontend - the repository you are visiting now 
- [backend](https://github.com/Leanka/Trello-backend)
